echo "$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S') | Setting up Question 16: Troubleshooting kube-apiserver and kube-scheduler"

# This question doesn't require additional resources as it's about troubleshooting
# existing cluster components. The scenario will be simulated by:
# 1. Stopping the services (simulated)
# 2. Creating configuration issues (simulated)
# 3. Providing troubleshooting steps
